## Programming

Efficient and effective programming is what brings our robot to life. We utilize various programming techniques, including autonomous routines and driver control programs, to maximize our robot's capabilities on the field.

## Competition Highlights

We've participated in several VEX competitions, each offering valuable experiences and lessons.
