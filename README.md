Welcome to the official repository of VEX Robotics Team 36830Z - Wingman! This repository contains all the code for the robot and all the extra resources we use. This repository is purely to document code changes and to provide an example of what "professional" robot code looks like to other VRC teams. Thus, we will not be accepting pull requests.

## Robot Design

Our robot design is the result of careful planning, iterative prototyping, and attention to detail. We believe that a well-designed robot is the foundation of success in VEX competitions.

## Programming

Efficient and effective programming is what brings our robot to life. We utilize various programming techniques, including autonomous routines and driver control programs, to maximize our robot's capabilities on the field.

## Competition Highlights

We've participated in several VEX competitions, each offering valuable experiences and lessons.
